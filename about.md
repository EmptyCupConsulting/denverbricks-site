## About the Organizers

### Jason Horner ‚Äî Owner and SME
My name is **Jason Horner**, and I have been attending and leading user groups in the Denver area since 2000. I‚Äôm an independent consultant, primarily working with Azure tools to deliver BI and advanced analytics solutions. Over the years, I‚Äôve delivered and contributed to several Databricks projects‚Äîwhile Databricks is currently a smaller part of my consulting practice, I want to deepen my engagement with the platform and community.

In addition to consulting, I provide and deliver training independently and as a subcontractor for Microsoft, and I occasionally work on exam development. I currently serve on the local **DAMA Rocky Mountain Chapter (DAMA-RMC)** board as the **VP of Professional Development**, where I am responsible for delivering our CDMP certification study groups.

My main interest in running this group is to stay more connected to the Databricks ecosystem, learn from peers, and help foster a vibrant local community.

### Co-Organizers
TBD
